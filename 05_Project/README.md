`Connotative Document Lookup`

We'll be searching for terms, sentences or paragraphs of similar meaning. You will agree that this application can be quite helpful and time-saving if you have ever had to look through a large paper for information that you cannot exactly recollect. This search would solve this problem by making a searching algorithm using Sentence embeddings and POS tagging and a moving window which searches based on similar meaning to the input given by the user.
