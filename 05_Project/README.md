`Connotative Document Lookup`

We'll be searching for terms, sentences or paragraphs of similar meaning. If you ever had to search a massive document for a piece of information that you cannot recall exactly, you will agree that this application can be extremely useful and time-saving. Instead of searching the actual word or sentence you can use a query which makes connotative sense to the abstract. Hence this search would solve this problem by making a searching algorithm using Sentence embeddings and POS tagging and a moving window which searches based on similar meaning to the input given by the user.
